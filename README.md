The official Tokyo 2020 font was developed by [Morisawa](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/news/morisawa-official-font-tokyo-2020), a Japanese type foundry, and appears to be unavailable for public use. After a bit of digging, I therefore decided to use the [Freeroad Regular font](https://webfonts.ffonts.net/Freeroad-Regular.font), which is a close approximation of the ["industrial `sans serif`"](https://fontmeme.com/images/TOKYO-2020-NEW.gif) seen in the Games' [(redesigned)](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/25/tokyo-2020-organisers-unveil-new-logo-olympic-plagiarism-allegations) [logo](https://fontmeme.com/images/TOKYO-2020-NEW.gif), for all primary headings across the site. To complement this, I chose [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=raleway), a popular `sans serif` font available via Google Fonts, as the default `body` font.

## Features

### Existing features:

- #### [Landing page:](https://going-for-gold.netlify.app/)
<details>
  <summary>
  <b>click to view</b>
  </summary>

As showcased in the [images above](#going-for-gold), the first thing the user sees upon landing is a visually appealing Olympic rings logo animation (lasting approximately four seconds), followed by a further trickle-down/fade-in animation effect involving a trio of call-to-action buttons (one representing each Olympic medal category of gold ('MEDALLISTS'), silver ('ABOUT') and bronze ('CONTACT')). These three buttons are centred on all screen sizes, and act as de facto navigational aids in lieu of the site's actual navigation menu (which has been hidden here in an effort not to overload visitors with too much information within the first few seconds). Clicking on any one of these CTA buttons takes the user to the page denoted by the button text.

</details>

- #### [Medallists page:](https://going-for-gold.netlify.app/medallists)

  <details>

  | ![](docs/images/screenshots/medallists-mobile.png) | ![](docs/images/screenshots/medallists-tablet.png) | ![](docs/images/screenshots/medallists-desktop.png) |
  | :------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
  |                       mobile                       |                       tablet                       |                       desktop                       |

  The Medallists page is the site's main page content-wise. In its default state, it gives a list of all 93 medal-winning countries from the Tokyo Games with a breakdown of the following data for each individual country:

  - National flag (pulled from a REST Countries API endpoint)
  - Country name (as above)
  - Population (as above)
  - Gold medals won at Tokyo 2020 (taken from the app's local data file)
  - Gold medals per one million citizens (calculated from the two relevant figures above)
  - Total medals won at Tokyo 2020 (taken from the app's local data file)
  - Total medals per one million citizens (calculated from the two relevant figures above)

  | :---------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
  |                     blue (Europe)                     |                    black (Africa)                     |                     red (Americas)                      |                    yellow (Asia)                    |                    green (Oceania)                     |

  In addition to this, the UI for each medallist includes a dynamically-rendered background image consisting of the aforementioned Tokyo 2020 emblem in the relevant Olympic ring colour that corresponds to that country's continent. Initially, these `.container-flag` elements were being differentially coloured based on their index number (using array iteration). It was actually my mentor Tim who alerted me to the fact that the five Olympic ring colours [represent the five main continents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols#:~:text=The%201949%E2%80%9350%20edition%20of,%2C%20and%20red%20for%20America%22). After learning of this, I was able to conditionally target the `background-image` property of each of these elements based on the "region" property value of each corresponding item returned from the REST Countries API endpoint.

  | :-------------------------------------------------: |
  |                    `<FaAward />`                    |

  One more feature displayed for each medallist is a dynamically-rendered React Icon with numerical ranking corresponding to that particular country's standing (these values are bound to the index of each country when iterating through the overall array)

- #### [About page:](https://going-for-gold.netlify.app/about)

  <details>
    <summary>

  |                      mobile                      |                      tablet                      |                      desktop                      |

  As you might expect, the site's About page presents users with a brief rundown on the site's purpose and intentions - all done in an engaging and aesthetically-pleasing manner. The parent `.container-about` element has been styled with a faint Tokyo 2020 logo `background-image`, while the page's main UI elements (heading, paragraphs of text and a bright CTA button) all transition into view thanks to staggered CSS `animation` effects on tablet and desktop (see image below)

    <b>click to view</b>

  | ![](docs/images/screenshots/contact-ui-mobile.jpg) | ![](docs/images/screenshots/contact-ui-tablet.jpg) | ![](docs/images/screenshots/contact-ui-desktop.jpg) |
  | :------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
  |                       mobile                       |                       tablet                       |                       desktop                       |

  As with most Contact pages, a `form` element is the centrepiece of this section of the site. Going for Gold's form boasts a neumorphic design, and is vertically and horizontally centred across all device sizes. A concise form submission sequence comprising two `input` fields followed by a `textarea` and a 'SEND' button means the user is not bombarded with too many requests or criteria. Strict form validation (outlined in detail below) has nevertheless been put into place to constrain user input. Once the form has been successfully submitted, the user is taken to a custom confirmation screen, which also contains a helpful CTA button guiding them back to the Home page.

### Potential future features:

<details>
  <summary>
  <b>click to view</b>
  </summary>

- #### Individual breakout pages for each country:

  Given more time, I would have been able to build this expanded feature into the current version of the app. A standalone component could be dynamically populated with more granular information about each country's medal haul: for example, appropriate use of React icons could highlight the Olympic events in which that particular nation was successful. Names of athletes/winners could also be listed, perhaps along with a more detailed look at that country's Olympic Games success rate historically.

- #### Aggregate the data to compile relative medal-winning stats for each of the five continents represented by the Olympic rings:

  This would be a fun and interesting add-on I feel, and would once again shine a slightly alternative light on what is a veritable ocean of Olympics-related stats and datasets. It would actually be quite easy to implement, and could similarly be used to run down both total and per capita figures for each continent.

- #### Expand the scope of the project to also incorporate the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games:

  More than just a nice-to-have, this is a feature that ought really to have been included from the start in the current MVP. However, three factors combined to prevent me from readily including corresponding figures for Paralympic medal-winning countries:

  - There simply isn't the same availability of data (and/or APIs) related to the Paralympics, so a good bit more digging would have been required to find appropriately malleable numbers
  - The Paralympic Games were still actually taking place throughout most of this project's development life cycle, and so trying to gather data would necessarily have constituted something of a 'moving target' exercise
  - Finally, as is so often the case, the project deadline approached quicker than I would have liked, and I was mindful of [not falling into the familiar trap](https://quotefancy.com/quote/757101/Tom-Cargill-The-first-90-percent-of-the-code-accounts-for-the-first-90-percent-of-the) of feature creep

- #### ["Infinite scroll"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) and/or pagination:

  One of a number of necessary trade-offs made to ensure the overall project made it over the finish line inside its submission dealine. A dynamic 'back-to-top' button component has been put in place to compensate for the absence of both of the above, and it is hoped this will help improve UX sufficiently until such time as I'm able to add these convenient features.

- #### Site-wide dark mode:

  At present, the user is only able to toggle dark mode on or off while browsing the main Medallists page. Ideally, this feature should be available throughout the application to give a more coherent and complete feel. However, it's worth noting that the site's [About page](https://going-for-gold.netlify.app/about) has been styled with a 'dark mode-like' background colour by default, and that the neumorphic styling that's been applied to the [Contact form](https://going-for-gold.netlify.app/contact) would also likely be affected by dark mode being enabled there.

I also decided to abbreviate the verbose country name versions of ['Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)'](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/venezuela), [United States of America](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/usa), [Syrian Arab Republic](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/syria), [Moldova (Republic of)](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/moldova), [Korea (Republic of)](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/kr), [Iran (Islamic Republic of)](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/iran) and ['Republic of Kosovo'](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/kosovo), in keeping with the site's overall minimalist aesthetic

The situation in relation to Great Britain/The United Kingdom (or "Team GB", as they are informally known nowadays) at the Olympics is naturally [quite complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB#Calls_for_renaming) and [frequently](https://inews.co.uk/sport/olympics/team-gb-why-not-uk-olympics-tokyo-2020-name-british-explained-1122737) [misunderstood](https://twitter.com/daraobriain/status/1418897202471227394). Either way, seeing as the official Olympic website adheres to [calling them 'Great Britain'](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/olympic-games/en/results/all-sports/medal-standings.htm), this was the preferred nomenclature adopted by the developer. To that end, the lengthy name of ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland' returned from the API endpoint](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/great%20britain) was reformatted manually through the use of conditional logic within the Medallists component.
